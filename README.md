# signup_login
This Python Tkinter app allows users to sign up and log in. It connects to a MySQL database to store user data (name, mobile, email, address, Aadhar, and password). It validates input fields like name, mobile, and email. After successful signup, data is saved. Login checks credentials, granting access if valid.
